# Scuffed Projects

### Map Generator
Doesn't actually generate a map. I wanted an excuse to learn ILGPU, and was wondering if I could accomplish any maplike behavior with just things I learned in Image Processing (I couldn't).
Perhaps one day I will look up actually generate a map (I won't).

### Super Scuffed 3D Renderer
I was too lazy to learn Unity, so I wrote a terrible renderer myself instead since I got [inspired](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz0KTGYJtUk) to try out ray tracing myself because it sounded fun.
